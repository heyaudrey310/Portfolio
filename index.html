        <p>From a foreclosure coordinator to a web developer! This aspiring web developer came from humble
            beginnings. Daughter of immigrant parents, I was born in Brooklyn, NY and raised in Levittown, PA. Harry
            S Truman was the high school I attended, and Penn State University was the college I went to (Go PSU!)
            <br> Working as a foreclosure coordinator for an asset management company was great, and my coworkers are
            awesome. However, I knew deep down this isn't where I wanted to go career-wise. The thought of using my
            creativity to create websites, thrills and frightens me. But that's the risk I'm willing to take!<br>
            With family and relatives that are majority doctors and nurses, it was no surprise how shocked they
            were that I had chosen a different career path. <br> All with good reason! With the support of my family,
            my friends, my current work and UPenn LPS Coding Program, I hope to succeed in becoming a web developer!</p>
